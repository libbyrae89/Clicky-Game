Clicky Game

Game Instructions: Every time a cat is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order. The goal is to click on each cat only once. If the user clicks the same cat twice, the score is reset and the game restarts.

The game utilizes React and requires you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.
